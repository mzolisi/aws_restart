Eagles are large, powerful birds of prey that are known for their strength and soaring flight: 

Size
Eagles are some of the largest and strongest birds in the world, with heavy heads and beaks. The smallest eagle species is the Great Nicobar serpent eagle, which weighs 1 lb and is 16 in long. 

Hunting
Eagles are aggressive hunters that use their powerful eyes to find prey and their strong wings to fly high and fast. They hunt medium-sized and small animals, and some species will steal prey from other predators. 
Nesting
Eagles often build their nests in tall trees or on mountains to keep their young safe. 
Habitat
Eagles can be found on every continent except Antarctica, but most live in Africa and Asia. 
Threats
Eagles are threatened by climate change, hunting, habitat loss, and electrocution from power lines. Many species are now at risk of illegal shooting and poisoning. 
Symbolism
Eagles have held a special place in the human imagination for a long time, and the golden eagle has been a symbol of power since ancient times.
