Rufio was a member of the Lost Boys who had assumed command after their leader, Peter Pan, left Neverland to grow up. When an adult Peter returned, Rufio did not believe that he was truly Peter and refused to accept him.

But after Peter had regained his powers, Rufio gave him back his sword as a sign of acceptance. Rufio was later killed by Captain Hook and died in Peter's arms.

After Peter's confrontation with Hook which had ended with Rufio's death, Peter passed on leadership over the Lost Boys to Thud Butt.
